                In exploring relationships, an important relationship to consider is how the TV series relates to events in the book it is based on, "A Song of Ice and Fire". <br><br>
                Does survival in the harsh world of Westeros depend more on martial prowess or on the ability to build alliances? Are those entangled in numerous battles more likely to meet an early end, or do their combative engagements bolster their chances of survival?<br><br>
                The scatterplot below serves as a revealing lens, highlighting how the threads of warfare and social connections intertwine with the fates of the characters. Each point plotted highlights how many chapters a character survives through in the book. <br><br>
                You can explore how a character's longevity in the book relates to the number of battles they are involved or the number of relationships they have.
